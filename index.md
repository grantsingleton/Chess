## Description
This is a fully functional chess game that can be played over a network between two humans, a human and a computer, or computer vs. computer. It can also be played locally. It is written in Java. Java Swing is used as the graphics package for the GUI build. Java Sockets are used for client-server communication which enables the game to be played over a network. This game was developed by a team of 4 students using the Agile development process. The team consisted of myself, Joshua Anderson, Lily Nguyen, and Lucas Crockett. I built the GUI, move logic, and the client-server model. Lucas wrote the move validation functions and pawn upgrades, as well as performing final debugging and testing. Lily designed the menu, and performed final testing, and Joshua programmed the AI.
